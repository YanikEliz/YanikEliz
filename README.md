# Hi, I’m Eliz 👋  

AI-focused full-stack engineer with an M.S. in Computational & Applied Mathematics (GPA 3.91). I build secure, distributed systems and privacy-preserving machine learning pipelines designed for real-world, compliance-sensitive environments.

My work sits at the intersection of backend architecture, encrypted ML, adversarial robustness, and real-time system design.

## 🔒 Research: Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks

Designed and evaluated encrypted neural network pipelines using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (CKKS scheme via TenSEAL).

- Implemented encrypted inference workflows in PyTorch  
- Simulated adversarial perturbations and mitigation strategies in encrypted space  
- Applied Integrated Gradients for model explainability  
- Compared encrypted vs baseline models using MSE and R² metrics  
- Applied to the OASIS Alzheimer’s dataset  

Tech: Python, PyTorch, TenSEAL, ONNX, Docker (GPU acceleration)
